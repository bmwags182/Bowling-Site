Bowling Statistics
==================

This was built as practice with php and mysql, I wanted a simple app to keep track of bowling games and keep a running average.

TODO: get average of all games entered for user
TODO: make front end page for viewing games listed out
TODO: make front end page for viewing spacific games with full frame data
TODO: make home page to explain purpose
TODO: make contact page
TODO: maths to calculate score based on frame data and input onto front end page with FULL score sheet
TODO: make logo for site
TODO: CSS styling in general, front and back end
TODO: make mobile responsive enough to feel like an app
